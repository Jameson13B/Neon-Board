# [Neon Board](https://neon-board.atomic10.studio)

Lightweight multiplayer game framework with **Firebase Firestore**. Build board games, card games, and live multiplayer experiences with Firebase — no game server required.

- **State + actions** — Define your game state and action reducers (like Flux). The board applies actions; everyone stays in sync.
- **Multiplayer, realtime** — One shared game in Firestore. Board and players see the same state instantly across devices.
- **Hooks-first** — React hooks for create, join, state, and actions. Use the imperative API in vanilla JS or non-React code.
- **Board as source of truth** — Only the board writes state and advances turn/phase. Simple rules, no conflicting writes.
